    "\n",
    "* Tokenization is the process of dividing a sequence of text, such as a sentence or a paragraph, into individual units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or even smaller units like subwords or syllables, depending on the specific tokenization approach used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis because it breaks down text into smaller meaningful units, enabling further analysis and processing. By splitting text into tokens, we can analyze and manipulate the text on a granular level, which is necessary for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, consider the sentence: \"The cat is sitting on the mat.\" After tokenization, this sentence could be represented as a list of tokens: [\"The\", \"cat\", \"is\", \"sitting\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\", \".\"]. Each word and the punctuation mark are considered as separate tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tokenization can involve several considerations, such as handling punctuation, dealing with contractions (e.g., splitting \"can't\" into \"can\" and \"'t\"), recognizing special tokens (e.g., numbers or URLs), and more. Different tokenization techniques and libraries, like NLTK or spaCy in Python, provide various approaches to tokenization, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your specific NLP task."

    "* Let's simplify the concept of stemming with a layman's example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine you have a collection of words related to the concept of \"running\": run, runs, running, runner, and ran. The stem of all these words is \"run\" because they share the same basic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stemming algorithms apply specific rules to identify and remove common word affixes. By doing so, they convert related words into their common base form. This process allows us to consolidate different variations of a word into a single representation, which can be useful for various NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here are a few examples to illustrate stemming:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. Word: \"Jumping\"\n",

    "* 3. Word: \"Dancing\"\n",
    "*    Stem: \"Danc\"\n",

    "* Stemming is used in applications like search engines, text mining, and sentiment analysis, where understanding the general concept of a word is more important than its specific grammatical form. **However, it's important to note that stemming is a crude approximation, and it may not always produce accurate stems or preserve the exact meaning of words. There can be cases where the resulting stem may not be a valid word in the language**.\n",

    "* Let's explain lemmatisation with a layman's example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consider a sentence with the words \"am,\" \"are,\" and \"is.\" The lemma for all these words is \"be\" because they are different forms of the verb \"to be.\" Lemmatisation recognizes that these variations share the same underlying meaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "* 3. Word: \"Better\"\n",

    "* The \"bag of words\" is a technique used in natural language processing to represent text data. It involves counting the occurrences of words in a document without considering the order or structure of the words.\n",

    "* Imagine you have a collection of sentences: \n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. \"The cat is on the mat.\"\n",
    "* 2. \"The dog is on the mat.\"\n",
    "* 3. \"The cat and the dog are friends.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* To create a bag of words representation, you would first make a list of all the unique words in these sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [\"The\", \"cat\", \"is\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\", \"dog\", \"and\", \"are\", \"friends\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, you would count the number of times each word appears in each sentence and create a vector for each sentence. The order of the words doesn't matter. Let's represent each sentence as a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "* 2. [2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "* 3. [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* This bag of words representation is useful for various tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, or information retrieval. Although it loses information about word order, it simplifies the text to numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms to analyze or classify the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The disadvantages of Bag of words is that if the frequency of two words is same then it will give the same weight to both of words,Even if the second word has most important for the sentiment which we analyse but bag words will give equal weightage so **thats why bag words not prefer much instead of it we use TF-IDF(Term Frequecy Inverse Document Frequency)**"

    "\n",
    "* **1. Term Frequency (TF)**: This measures how frequently a word appears in a document. It assumes that the more times a word appears, the more important it is in that particular document.\n",
    "* **Formula of TF= (Number of times the word present in that sentence)/Total number of words present in that sentence**\n",

    "   - In CBOW, the model predicts the target word based on the context words around it.\n",
    "   - For example, given the sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat,\" the context words for the target word \"sat\" might be \"The,\" \"cat,\" \"on,\" and \"the.\"\n",
    "   - The model learns to predict the target word \"sat\" based on these context words.\n",

    "2. Skip-gram:\n",
    "   - In Skip-gram, the model predicts the context words given a target word.\n",
    "   - Using the same example sentence, the model would predict the context words \"The,\" \"cat,\" \"on,\" and \"the\" based on the target word \"sat.\"\n",
    "   - The model learns to generate the likely context words based on the target word.\n",
    "\n",
